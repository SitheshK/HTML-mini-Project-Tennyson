        <br><pa>Four Arms is one of Ben Tennyson's most iconic alien transformations from the Omnitrix in the Ben 10 franchise.

He stands over 12 feet tall, with red skin, black markings, and muscular build. Four Arms can easily lift heavy objects, smash through walls, and defeat multiple enemies at once. Despite his size, he can jump great distances and create shockwaves by clapping his hands together.

        <br><pa>Swampfire is one of Ben Tennyson’s powerful alien forms introduced in Ben 10: Alien Force. He is a Methanosian, a plant-based alien species from the planet Methanos.
Swampfire resembles a humanoid plant with green vines, mud-like skin, and yellowish flames on his head. He has the power to control fire, regenerate damaged body parts, and manipulate plants—making him extremely versatile in battle. Despite his swampy appearance, he is both strong and intelligent, able to fight with brute force or use nature and fire creatively.
Swampfire can shoot fireballs, create roots and vines to trap enemies, and even heal himself from injuries by regenerating his biomass. He’s often used by Ben when facing tough, fiery, or regenerating enemies.</pa></div>

Cannonbolt is a large, bulky alien with thick, armored skin and black and white markings. His most unique ability is to curl into a ball like an armadillo and roll at high speeds, turning himself into a living cannonball. When rolled up, his armor becomes nearly indestructible, allowing him to crash through obstacles, enemies, and walls with ease.
Despite his size, Cannonbolt can move incredibly fast in his rolled-up form, and his powerful shell makes him excellent for both offense and defense. He’s a favorite choice when Ben needs to break through barriers or take heavy hits.</pa></div>

One of his most amazing powers is the ability to duplicate himself, allowing him to outnumber and overwhelm enemies. He can also combine his sound powers with his clones to unleash massive sonic attacks.

Way Big stands over 295 feet tall, towering over buildings and enemies alike. He has white and red armor-like skin, a finned head, and glowing green eyes. His size gives him incredible strength, but what truly makes him powerful is his ability to unleash cosmic energy beams by spinning his arms — known as the "Cosmic Ray" attack.
Despite his size, Way Big is fast and agile for a giant, able to leap across great distances and handle enormous threats like monsters, robots, and even space entities. Ben usually saves Way Big for final battles or world-ending threats due to his unmatched power.</pa></div>

Humungousaur resembles a 10-foot-tall humanoid dinosaur with brown skin, thick muscles, and a powerful tail. His primary power is super strength, making him capable of lifting and throwing huge objects, breaking through barriers, and overpowering large enemies with ease.
One of his unique abilities is size growth — he can grow up to 60 feet tall, increasing his strength and power even more. He also has enhanced durability, making him a tank in battle, able to take hits from heavy weapons or enemies without being phased.
Humungousaur is Ben’s go-to alien when brute force and raw power are needed, especially in battles with giant creatures or machines.

        <br><pa>Wildmutt is a feral, beast-like alien that Ben Tennyson can transform into using the Omnitrix. He is a Vulpimancer from the planet Vulpin, a dark and toxic world where sight is useless, and other senses are highly developed.
Wildmutt has an orange, muscular body with no eyes, nose, or ears, and is covered in porcupine-like quills along his back. Despite lacking vision, Wildmutt has enhanced senses, especially smell and hearing, which allow him to detect enemies even in total darkness or from far away.
He moves like a wild animal — running on all fours, leaping great distances, and attacking with his sharp claws and teeth. Wildmutt also has super strength, agility, and is extremely difficult to predict in battle due to his primal fighting style.
Ben often uses Wildmutt when stealth, speed, or heightened senses are needed — especially in situations where tracking or navigating through dangerous terrain is key.</pa></div>

Chromastone has a sleek, humanoid body made of purple and magenta crystalline material, with glowing energy patterns and a gem-like core at the center of his chest. His body is extremely durable, allowing him to withstand powerful attacks, including lasers and explosions.
His most unique ability is the power to absorb energy attacks (like lasers or electricity) and redirect or amplify them through his body, releasing devastating energy blasts. He also has flight capabilities, super strength, and light-based energy projection.
Chromastone is often used when Ben needs to face enemies who use energy-based weapons or powers, making him both a shield and a weapon in one.</pa></div>

        <center><h3>GHOSTFREAK</h3><img src="./images/ghost frek.jpg"width="500px"height="500px"></center>
        <br><pa>Ghostfreak is a phantom-like alien that Ben Tennyson can transform into using the Omnitrix. He is an Ectonurite, a species from the dark and haunted planet Anur Phaetos.
Ghostfreak has a ghostly, semi-transparent body with a single, exposed eye, sharp claws, and a striped cloak-like skin that can peel back to reveal a terrifying form underneath. He possesses a wide range of spooky abilities. Ghostfreak was initially part of Ben’s original aliens but became a threat when the alien’s consciousness (Zs'Skayr) escaped the Omnitrix and turned evil. This gave Ghostfreak a darker, more fearsome role in the series.
Ben eventually regains control of the Ghostfreak transformation in later series but uses it cautiously due to its dangerous history.</pa></div>
